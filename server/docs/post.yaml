      description: |
        Creates a new post with optional image uploads. Supports two modes:
        1. **With file uploads**: Upload images as multipart/form-data (up to 4 images, 10MB each). Images are automatically processed (resized to max 2000x2000, compressed, converted to WebP).
        2. **With URLs**: Send image URLs in JSON body (legacy support).
